This repository serves as a convenient location for course-related notebooks, slides, and PDFs.

Notebooks can be **viewed statically** directly on GitHub; however, **some elements may not render correctly**. For accurate display, the notebooks must be **executed**. A convenient yet restricted method to achieve this is by opening them in Google Colab; links to open in Colab are provided at the beginning of each notebook. For additional options and a setup guide, please refer to the inaugural lecture's notebook available [here in its static form](https://github.com/dgdi/codepy_UNIPD/blob/main/notebooks/lecture01_introSetup.ipynb).
